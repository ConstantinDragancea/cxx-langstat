Steps of creating a new analysis:
1. Create YourAnalysis.cpp and YourAnalysis.h
2. In YourAnalysis.h, create header guards: YOURANALYSIS_H etc.
3. include YourAnalysis.h in YourAnalysis.cpp
4. add analysis to CMakeLists.txt
5. add analysis to AnalysisRegistry.cpp
6. Implement analyzeFeatures and processFeatures in YourAnalysis.cpp
7. advisable to have specialized object/data structure that holds features in a certain way
and then implement functions to convert to/from JSON and that object

Issues
analyzeFeatures and processFeatures should be renamed s.t. they reflect what they do
